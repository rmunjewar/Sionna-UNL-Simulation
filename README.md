# Sionna-UNL-Simulation

Wireless communication simulation for University of Nebraska-Lincoln buildings using Sionna ray tracing.

## Overview

Simulates WiFi signal propagation across multiple UNL buildings by comparing measured RSSI data with ray-traced predictions. Generates visualizations and validation overlays for building coverage analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Sionna (optional, falls back to simplified model if unavailable)
- TensorFlow (required if using Sionna)

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
pip install sionna tensorflow  # Optional, for ray tracing
```

## Reproducing Results

To reproduce all numerical results and visualizations:

1. **Generate scene files** (creates XML files in `scenes/` directory):

   ```bash
   python scene_builder.py
   ```

2. **Run simulations** (processes data and generates all results):
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The simulation will:

- Load measurement data from `Wireless Communications - Data Collection - Data-4.csv`
- Process all buildings listed in the configuration
- Generate comparison plots, scene layouts, and validation overlays
- Output summary statistics to console and `results/summary.png`

## Expected Output Files

After running both scripts, the `results/` directory will contain:

- `{Building}_comparison.png` - Comparison plots (measured vs simulated RSSI)
- `{Building}_scene_layout.png` - Building geometry with measurement points
- `{Building}_validation_overlay.png` - Validation view with AP and receiver positions
- `summary.png` - Overall statistics across all buildings

Buildings processed: Kiewit, Adele Coryell, Love Library South, Selleck, Brace, Hamilton, Bessey, Union, Oldfather, Memorial Stadium.

## Files

- `main.py` - Main simulation runner and visualization generator
- `scene_builder.py` - Building scene geometry generator
- `Wireless Communications - Data Collection - Data-4.csv` - Measurement data (must be in root directory)
- `scenes/` - XML scene files for each building (generated by scene_builder.py)
- `results/` - Generated visualizations and analysis plots (created by main.py)

## Notes

- If Sionna is not available, the simulation will automatically use a simplified propagation model
- All numerical results (MAE, RMSE, error metrics) are printed to console and saved in visualizations
- Results are deterministic when using the same input data and scene files
